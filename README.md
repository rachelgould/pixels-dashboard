# Pixels Mood Tracker Dashboard

This project is for those who use the Pixels app to track their mood, and want to visualize the data. This is a work in progress.

# How It Works

1. Download the JSON export of your data in the pixels app. 
2. Replace `raw.json` with your data export (the file must also be called `raw.json`). 
3. In terminal: `cd gatsby && npm i && gatsby develop`
4. Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in your browser
